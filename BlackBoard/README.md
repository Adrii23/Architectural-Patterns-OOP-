This factory uses multiple workers to produce the chairs faster.  
When using Blackboard, we have 6 workers : Ion:C, Vasile:F, Viorel:F, Petru:B, Gheo:S, Costi:P.  
Knowledge Source - every worker knows his operation and if he can operate on a chair at a certain point.  
Workers operate on a blackboard that has unfinished chairs.   
Each worker knows, by looking at a chair, if he can operate on it or not.  
The chairs are accessed randomly.    
The disadvantage of this pattern is that workers access the blackboard too many times in their search of chairs that need their attention.  
We assume that the workers work as : Ion=10 min, Petru=15 min, Vasile=40 min, Gheo=20 min, Costi=10 min.
